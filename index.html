                It was not I moving permamently to Los Angelas, but </b>
                I was assisting my brother in this daunting move across the United States.<br>
                We started out having to get his life packed into a Subaru WRX, 
                a lot harder than we had initially anticipated.<br> Took a lot of compacting along with
                tears, from having to leave things behind, for my brother to make it work.

            <p>These were all locations him and I chose to pick based on how many excess miles we would have to drive
                <br>along with how bad we wanted to see some great sites.

            <h2 class = "place"><b>Petrified Forest</b></h2>
            <p>The name of this place in itself had me enthralled, what was waiting for me in the Forest<br>
                was incredible. Large stones that took the form of wood, bark, and branches. Petrified wood is<br>
                created when the organic materials of wood are replaced with minerals such as opal or quartz.<br> 
                Incredible sight to seean entire forest made of rocks.

            <h2 class = "place"><b>Grand Canyon</b></h2>
            <p>I have seen pictures with pictures on top of pictures of the Grand Canyon, <br>
                of the incredible views of the massive canyon and its grandeur. I will have<br>
                to say though, none of them compare in the slightest to being present there and <br>
                witnessing that splendor in person. It was January when my brother had decided to <br>
                do the actual move so all of the upper part of the canyon was snow covered.

            <h2 class = "place"><b>Las Vegas</b></h2>
            <p>After being able to see the breath-taking Grand Canyon, we had planned to drive through Las Vegas.<br>
            While driving there it began to get dark, we started to get tired, and thought we were seeing things.<br>
            Driving through the pitch black, then among the horizon we began to see feignt glow in the distance of the<br>
            famed City of Lights! This was an delightfully unexpected welcome to the city considering i've heard so<br> 
            much about it. Upon coming to the city we decided to get a hotel room for the night and have an overly price<br>
            meal, both where phenomenal.

            <h2 class = "place"><b>Los Angeles</b></h2>
            <p>Staying the night in Las Vegas had boosted our energy and motivation to move toward our final<br>
                destination, Los Angeles. There was a lot to see coming into the city and best of all, the TRAFFIC!
                <br>My brother moved into an appartment with some friends, got to do some sight seeing and see<br>
                Venice Beach! There were some incredible views in LA, even through the bustling city.

        <p>All in all this was an incredible trip for myself and an insane adventure for my brother, he's been living out there for<br>
        the past 3 years and is enjoying himself. I have wanted to visit his new place out there, but life has been hectic recently.<br>
        This drive alone made me want to explore the world and open my horizons to new places and ideas, a memorable trip to say the least.</p>
